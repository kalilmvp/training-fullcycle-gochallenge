<h1>Go Challenge</h1>

<h3>FullCycle Platform</h3>

I built the Go file on a MacOS. For setting the binary to execute at a Linux OS, it was necessary to build it with the command:

```
env GOOS=linux GOARCH=amd64 go build hello-world.go
```

Run the command to print: <b>Code.education Rocks!</b>

```
docker run kalilmvp/codeeducation
```
